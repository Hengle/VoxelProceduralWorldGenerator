# VoxelProceduralWorldGenerator
Contains easy-to-read, clean and highly optimized code that allows to create Minecraft-like worlds.

Important parts: 
- parallelisation (Unity JobSystem)
- procedural world generation with usage of the Perlin Noise 3D function
- basic shader for water (and to some extent also for terrain calculation)
- object and scene managment, save and load system
- destrutable ground
- trees!
